# The-Bachelor

Our project is on The Bachelor franchise; specifically, information about:

* where contestants and leads are from;
* comparison of occupations between male and female contestants;
* ages of contestants over time; 
* outcomes of contestants over time;
* episode ratings over time;
* ... 

We will pull the data by scraping from the Bachelor Fandom. We will also bring in data from other datasets if we find them.
